This was the final from my class where I learned SQL 

The "SQL Project Questions" will give you insight into the database and the questions I was solving for
The "SQL Project Data" is the data used for the project (in pdf and .sql)
The "Excelsior Create Tables/Insert Data" was the data imported before the project began
The "SQL Project Code" is the code I wrote to complete the project
